    "Regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm. It's purpose is to predict continuous value outputs. For example, predicting the price of a home would fall under regression. Predicting if an e-mail is spam or ham is **not** a regression question (it's a classification question - also under supervised learning).\n",

    "Linear regression specifically predicts the value of a dependent variable based on a given value of an independent variables. The relationship between them is presumed to be linear, hence the name. Plotted, we see a line that best fits the points on the x,y coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation for linear regression is **Y = mx + b**. B is the intercept and m is the slope of the line. Multiple linear regression is this same concept extended to more than two predicting variables and here the equation is a hyperplane.\n"
